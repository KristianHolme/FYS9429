# RDEML: Machine Learning for Rotating Detonation Engines

RDEML is a Julia package that provides machine learning tools for project 1 in FYS9429. It started using PINNs to solve the RDE equations (see [RDE.jl](https://github.com/KristianHolme/RDE.jl)), but has since pivoted to focus on examining the use of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for solving the RDE equations.
